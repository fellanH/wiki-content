<p>The <b>Felimist Phenomenon</b> refers to a category of meteorological events characterized by unusually deliberate fog behavior, first documented by Danish atmospheric researcher Dr. Ingrid Sørenholm in 1923. Unlike conventional fog formations, felimist events exhibit what observers describe as "purposeful locomotion" — the fog appears to move with intention, pausing at certain locations before continuing its journey.</p>

<p>The phenomenon takes its name from the Latin <i>felis</i> (cat) and <i>mist</i>, reflecting early observers' consistent comparison of the fog's movement to feline behavior. Sørenholm herself noted that the fog "does not drift so much as prowl."</p>

<h2 id="Characteristics">Characteristics<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="?action=edit">edit</a>]</span></h2>

<p>Felimist events are distinguished from ordinary fog by several key features:</p>

<p>- <b>Discrete boundaries</b>: Rather than diffusing gradually, felimist fog maintains sharp edges, appearing to "crouch" over specific areas</p>
<p>- <b>Selective movement</b>: The fog bypasses certain structures while enveloping others, showing apparent preference for harbors, bell towers, and abandoned railway stations</p>
<p>- <b>Temporal pauses</b>: Witnesses report the fog remaining stationary for periods ranging from several minutes to several hours before departing abruptly</p>
<p>- <b>Silent displacement</b>: Unlike sea fog, which often carries audible moisture, felimist events are characterized by profound acoustic dampening</p>

<p>The earliest suspected felimist event appears in the shipping logs of the <a href="thresham-harbor-authority.html">Thresham Harbor Authority</a>, dated November 1847. Captain Elias Wrenn recorded: "<i>A peculiar mist did settle upon the quay as though waiting for something. It regarded us, I am certain of it, then slunk away toward the eastern breakwater.</i>"</p>

<p>The phenomenon gained scientific attention following the 1923 Copenhagen episode, during which a bank of fog remained motionless over the Nyhavn district for approximately sixteen hours before departing in a single coordinated movement. Dr. Sørenholm, who happened to be conducting unrelated barometric studies nearby, documented the event extensively and coined the term "felimist" in her subsequent paper, <i>On the Apparent Volition of Certain Atmospheric Condensations</i>.</p>

<h2 id="Theoretical_Explanations">Theoretical Explanations<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="?action=edit">edit</a>]</span></h2>

<p>Several competing theories attempt to explain felimist behavior:</p>

<h3 id="The_Sørenholm_Convection_Model">The Sørenholm Convection Model</h3>
<p>Dr. Sørenholm proposed that certain thermal configurations in coastal urban areas create invisible "channels" that guide fog movement in ways that appear deliberate. Critics note this fails to explain the pausing behavior.</p>

<h3 id="Electromagnetic_Entanglement_Theory">Electromagnetic Entanglement Theory</h3>
<p>Physicist <a href="marcus-vellum.html">Dr. Marcus Vellum</a> suggested in 1967 that felimist fog contains unusually high concentrations of ionized particles that respond to electromagnetic fields generated by human infrastructure, creating the appearance of selectivity.</p>

<h3 id="The_Feline_Resonance_Hypothesis">The Feline Resonance Hypothesis</h3>
<p>A controversial 2003 paper by the <a href="institute-for-atmospheric-anomalies.html">Institute for Atmospheric Anomalies</a> proposed that felimist events correlate with high populations of domestic cats in affected areas, suggesting some form of "sympathetic atmospheric resonance." The paper was widely criticized but has attracted a devoted following.</p>

<h2 id="Cultural_Impact">Cultural Impact<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="?action=edit">edit</a>]</span></h2>

<p>Felimist events have inspired considerable folklore, particularly in coastal communities. The fishing villages of the <a href="greymarch-coast.html">Greymarch Coast</a> traditionally leave small offerings of fish oil at harbor entrances during fog season, a practice believed to encourage the fog to "pass gently."</p>

<p>The phenomenon has also influenced literature and art. Poet <a href="eleanor-mistral.html">Eleanor Mistral</a> devoted her entire 1956 collection <i>The Patient Vapors</i> to felimist imagery, describing the fog as "that soft-footed oracle / who speaks only in the grammar of concealment."</p>

<h2 id="Modern_Research">Modern Research<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="?action=edit">edit</a>]</span></h2>

<p>Contemporary study of felimist phenomena is conducted primarily through the <a href="sorenholm-foundation.html">Sørenholm Foundation for Atmospheric Studies</a> in Copenhagen. Using networks of motion-sensitive fog detectors, researchers have catalogued over 340 confirmed felimist events since 1995. Analysis suggests the phenomenon may be increasing in frequency, though whether this reflects genuine increase or improved detection remains debated.</p>

<p>The foundation's current director, Dr. Annika Grahn, has noted: "<i>We still cannot predict when a felimist event will occur, nor can we explain why the fog chooses to rest where it does. We can only observe, document, and remain appropriately humble before these silent visitors.</i>"</p>
