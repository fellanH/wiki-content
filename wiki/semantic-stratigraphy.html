        <p><b>Semantic stratigraphy</b> is a proposed methodology within <a href="chronolinguistics.html">chronolinguistics</a> and <a href="consciousness-archaeology.html">consciousness archaeology</a> for analyzing the layered deposits of meaning that accumulate in individual and collective memory systems. First outlined by Dr. Fiona MacLeod and Dr. Rashid Osman at the Edinburgh Institute for Temporal Studies in 2024, the approach adapts principles from <a href="/wiki/Stratigraphy">geological stratigraphy</a> to examine how meanings are deposited, compressed, transformed, and occasionally inverted over time.<sup><a href="#cite1">[1]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Unlike <a href="echo-cartography.html">echo cartography</a>, which maps the spatial distribution of meaning across semantic terrain, semantic stratigraphy focuses on the vertical dimension—the depth and sequence of meaning deposits at any given location in the <a href="mnemonic-commons.html">mnemonic commons</a>. The methodology treats meanings not as static entities but as sedimentary accumulations whose present form reflects their entire depositional history.<sup><a href="#cite2">[2]</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="Principle_of_superposition">Principle of superposition</h3>
        <p>Semantic stratigraphy adapts the geological <a href="/wiki/Law_of_superposition">principle of superposition</a> to the domain of meaning: in an undisturbed sequence of meaning deposits, the oldest meanings lie at the bottom and progressively younger meanings are deposited on top. This allows researchers to establish relative chronologies of semantic change by examining the order of layers.<sup><a href="#cite3">[3]</a></sup></p>

        <p>The principle holds that when a word or concept acquires a new meaning, this meaning does not replace but rather overlays the previous one, creating a stratified column of significations. The <b>semantic column</b> of any given term thus represents its complete history of meanings, with the most recent and accessible at the surface and earlier meanings compressed beneath.<sup><a href="#cite4">[4]</a></sup></p>

        <p>MacLeod and Osman identified three types of superposition relationships:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Conformable:</b> Continuous deposition where each new meaning builds logically upon prior meanings</li>
            <li><b>Disconformable:</b> Periods of non-deposition where a term remains semantically stable, followed by renewed accumulation</li>
            <li><b>Unconformable:</b> Interruptions where some meanings have been eroded before new deposition, creating gaps in the semantic record<sup><a href="#cite5">[5]</a></sup></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Meaning_horizons">Meaning horizons</h3>
        <p><b>Meaning horizons</b> are distinct, identifiable layers within the semantic column that represent specific periods or events of meaning deposition. Named by analogy to geological <a href="/wiki/Soil_horizon">soil horizons</a>, these layers can be identified by their characteristic properties:<sup><a href="#cite6">[6]</a></sup></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Composition:</b> The types of associative elements, connotations, and usage contexts embedded in the layer</li>
            <li><b>Texture:</b> The density and granularity of meaning—whether meanings are tightly packed or loosely associated</li>
            <li><b>Color:</b> The emotional or evaluative "tint" of meanings at that stratum (e.g., positive, neutral, negative, sacred, profane)</li>
            <li><b>Inclusions:</b> Distinctive semantic "fossils"—traces of historical usage, borrowed meanings, or preserved archaisms<sup><a href="#cite7">[7]</a></sup></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Standard notation designates horizons alphabetically from the surface downward (A, B, C, etc.), with subscripts indicating sub-horizons and special properties. The <b>A horizon</b> (surface) contains current, active meanings; the <b>B horizon</b> contains meanings that have undergone significant transformation; the <b>C horizon</b> contains weathered but recognizable parent meanings; and the <b>R horizon</b> (bedrock) contains the etymological foundations.<sup><a href="#cite8">[8]</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="Semantic_unconformities">Semantic unconformities</h3>
        <p>A <b>semantic unconformity</b> occurs when the normal sequence of meaning accumulation is disrupted, typically through one of three processes:<sup><a href="#cite9">[9]</a></sup></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Angular unconformity:</b> When meanings are deposited at different "angles" of usage, indicating a fundamental shift in how a term is employed. The older meanings were tilted or reoriented before new deposition began.</li>
            <li><b>Disconformity:</b> When a period of erosion removes some meanings before new deposition resumes, creating a gap in the record. Evidence of this includes missing expected intermediate meanings.</li>
            <li><b>Nonconformity:</b> When new meanings are deposited directly onto the etymological "bedrock" after all accumulated meanings have been stripped away, as occurs with radical <a href="semantic-drift.html">semantic drift</a> or deliberate linguistic reclamation.<sup><a href="#cite10">[10]</a></sup></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unconformities are particularly valuable to researchers because they record periods of semantic upheaval, linguistic revolution, or cultural trauma that disrupted normal patterns of meaning accumulation.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Every unconformity tells a story of what was lost. The gap itself is evidence—a scar in the semantic column where meanings were stripped away by forces we can only infer from what remains above and below."<br>
            — Dr. Fiona MacLeod, 2025
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="Methodology">Methodology<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="/wiki/Semantic_stratigraphy?action=edit&section=2">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <h3 id="Core_sampling">Core sampling</h3>
        <p>The primary data-gathering technique in semantic stratigraphy is <b>core sampling</b>—extracting a complete vertical section through the meaning layers of a term, concept, or <a href="mnemonic-commons.html">mnemonic commons</a> region. This produces a <b>semantic core</b> that can be analyzed layer by layer.<sup><a href="#cite11">[11]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Core sampling methods include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Historical corpus analysis:</b> Examining dated texts to recover the sequence of meaning changes over documented time</li>
            <li><b>Association excavation:</b> Using structured association tasks to probe different depths of meaning in individual minds</li>
            <li><b>Cross-generational sampling:</b> Comparing meaning profiles across age cohorts to infer temporal sequence</li>
            <li><b>Echo signature analysis:</b> Using <a href="echo-cartography.html">echo cartographic</a> techniques to detect residual traces of eroded meanings<sup><a href="#cite12">[12]</a></sup></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Layer_identification">Layer identification</h3>
        <p>Once a semantic core has been extracted, researchers employ several techniques to identify and characterize individual layers:<sup><a href="#cite13">[13]</a></sup></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Boundary detection:</b> Identifying sharp transitions in meaning properties that indicate horizon boundaries</li>
            <li><b>Index fossils:</b> Locating distinctive semantic elements that appear only in specific time periods, allowing correlation across cores</li>
            <li><b>Compaction assessment:</b> Measuring the degree to which meanings have been compressed, which correlates with age and burial depth</li>
            <li><b>Diagenetic analysis:</b> Examining how meanings have been chemically altered through long-term processes of association and inference</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Correlation_techniques">Correlation techniques</h3>
        <p>A major challenge in semantic stratigraphy is correlating layers across different semantic columns—establishing that horizon B in one word's column represents the same depositional period as horizon B in another's. The Edinburgh Institute has developed several correlation methods:<sup><a href="#cite14">[14]</a></sup></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Biostratigraphic correlation:</b> Using shared cultural references as "index fossils" to match layers across columns</li>
            <li><b>Event stratigraphy:</b> Identifying distinctive layers deposited by specific historical events (wars, technologies, social movements) that affected multiple terms simultaneously</li>
            <li><b>Chronometric dating:</b> Using <a href="lexical-half-life.html">lexical half-life</a> measurements to estimate absolute ages of layers</li>
            <li><b>Sequence stratigraphy:</b> Matching patterns of deposition and erosion across semantic columns<sup><a href="#cite15">[15]</a></sup></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="Depositional_contexts">Depositional contexts<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="/wiki/Semantic_stratigraphy?action=edit&section=3">edit</a>]</span></h2>
        <p>MacLeod and Osman identified several distinct <b>depositional environments</b> in which meanings accumulate with different characteristics:<sup><a href="#cite16">[16]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Understanding the depositional context of a layer aids in interpreting its properties and predicting its future behavior. Layers deposited in high-energy environments (e.g., social media) are more likely to be reworked or eroded, while those deposited in low-energy environments (e.g., legal terminology) may persist for centuries.<sup><a href="#cite17">[17]</a></sup></p>

        </ul>

        <p>The integration of stratigraphic methods with echo cartographic mapping has been particularly productive, allowing researchers to construct <b>semantic block diagrams</b>—three-dimensional representations showing both the horizontal extent and vertical structure of meaning formations across the <a href="mnemonic-commons.html">mnemonic commons</a>.<sup><a href="#cite20">[20]</a></sup></p>

        <h2 id="Applications">Applications<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="/wiki/Semantic_stratigraphy?action=edit&section=5">edit</a>]</span></h2>
        <p>Early applications of semantic stratigraphy have focused on several areas:<sup><a href="#cite21">[21]</a></sup></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Historical semantics:</b> Reconstructing the complete depositional history of culturally significant terms</li>
            <li><b>Etymology revision:</b> Using stratigraphic evidence to reassess traditional etymological narratives</li>

            <li><b>Artificial language design:</b> Engineering semantic columns with desired properties for constructed languages or technical vocabularies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Researchers at the Edinburgh Institute are currently developing applications in <b>predictive stratigraphy</b>—using knowledge of depositional patterns to forecast how current meaning formations will evolve. This work connects to emerging research on <a href="temporal-linguistics-engineering.html">temporal linguistics engineering</a>, which seeks to intentionally shape the future evolution of language.<sup><a href="#cite22">[22]</a></sup></p>

        <h2 id="Limitations">Limitations and challenges<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="/wiki/Semantic_stratigraphy?action=edit&section=6">edit</a>]</span></h2>
        <p>The methodology faces several significant challenges:<sup><a href="#cite23">[23]</a></sup></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Bioturbation:</b> Ongoing associative processes continually mix and disturb semantic layers, obscuring original stratification</li>
            <li><b>Observer effects:</b> The act of sampling meanings may alter the deposits being studied</li>
            <li><b>Incompleteness:</b> The semantic record is inherently incomplete; many meanings leave no trace, and erosion removes others</li>
            <li><b>Non-uniformitarianism:</b> Unlike geological processes, semantic deposition may not follow consistent rules across time and cultures</li>
            <li><b>Metaphor strain:</b> Critics argue the geological metaphor may be pushed beyond its useful limits, generating false precision about fundamentally different phenomena<sup><a href="#cite24">[24]</a></sup></li>
        </ul>

        <p>MacLeod has acknowledged these limitations while defending the methodology's utility: "We do not claim that meaning is literally sedimentary. We claim that treating it as if it were sedimentary reveals patterns that other approaches miss. The proof is in the discoveries."<sup><a href="#cite25">[25]</a></sup></p>
