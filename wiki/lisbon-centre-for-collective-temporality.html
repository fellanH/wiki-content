        <h3 id="Founding">Founding</h3>

        <p>The Centre was established in 2014 by Dr. Ines Marques, then a junior researcher at Universidade Nova de Lisboa who had become frustrated with the individual-focused methodology dominant in <a href="consciousness-archaeology.html">consciousness archaeology</a>. Marques had been the lead investigator of the <a href="lisbon-retrograde-event.html">Lisbon Retrograde Event of 2008</a>, a localized temporal anomaly in which approximately 8,200 individuals experienced 23 minutes of reversed temporal flow. Her work documenting this event demonstrated that certain temporal phenomena left traces that could not be recovered from any single witness but seemed to persist in some form across groups of witnesses. Her 2013 paper "The Interstitial Memory: Evidence for Relational Temporal Deposits" attracted attention from the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, leading to seed funding for the Centre.<sup><a href="#cite4">[4]</a></sup></p>

        <div class="timeline-box">
            <p><span class="timeline-year">2014</span> — Centre established with 8 researchers in temporary facilities at Universidade Nova de Lisboa</p>
            <p><span class="timeline-year">2015</span> — First successful TRM pilot study with 4 participants</p>

        </div>

        <p>The name "Collective Temporality" was chosen deliberately to distinguish the Centre's focus from both individual temporal perception (the domain of chronopsychology) and collective memory (which typically emphasizes semantic rather than temporal content). Marques argued that temporal experience itself could be shared in ways that existing frameworks did not adequately address.<sup><a href="#cite5">[5]</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="TRM">Development of TRM</h3>

        <p>The Centre's first years were devoted to developing the methodology that would become <a href="temporal-resonance-mapping.html">Temporal Resonance Mapping</a>. Building on the theoretical foundation of her 2013 paper, Marques conducted a series of pilot studies between 2015 and 2016 that demonstrated the feasibility of detecting correlated temporal deposits across multiple individuals. The key breakthrough came in late 2016 when researchers successfully reconstructed a shared temporal experience (a minor power fluctuation during a 2009 academic conference) that no individual participant could consciously recall but which produced measurable resonance signatures when the participants were examined together.<sup><a href="#cite6">[6]</a></sup></p>

        <blockquote>
            "For years, consciousness archaeology had been like trying to reconstruct a symphony by interviewing individual musicians one at a time. We showed that some harmonies only exist when you bring the musicians together and listen to what they still resonate with, not what they remember playing."<br>
            — Dr. Ines Marques, "Introduction to Temporal Resonance" (2018)
        </blockquote>

        <p>The formal methodology was published in 2017, coinciding with the Centre's move to its purpose-built facility in Belém. The new building incorporated specialized chambers for isolated participant preparation and a central "resonance lab" designed to minimize external interference during group mapping sessions.<sup><a href="#cite7">[7]</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="Recognition">International recognition</h3>

        <p>The Centre achieved international prominence following its involvement in investigating the <a href="great-meaning-collapse.html">Great Meaning Collapse of 2019</a>. While the collapse itself occurred across multiple continents, the Centre's Pre-Collapse Mapping Project (2019-2021) used TRM to identify previously unknown precursor events in Lisbon, Porto, Barcelona, and Lyon—minor localized temporal disturbances that preceded the main collapse by 48-72 hours and which had not been detected by other methodologies.<sup><a href="#cite8">[8]</a></sup></p>

        <p>This discovery established TRM as a legitimate investigative tool and led to collaborative agreements with major temporal research institutions. Dr. Sigríður Jónsdóttir of the <a href="reykjavik-institute-for-boundary-consciousness.html">Reykjavik Institute for Boundary Consciousness</a> described the Centre as "essential infrastructure for understanding collective temporal phenomena," and TRM protocols are now incorporated into RIBC's boundary event investigation procedures.<sup><a href="#cite9">[9]</a></sup></p>

        <h2 id="Research">Research divisions<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="#">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <p>The Centre operates three research divisions:<sup><a href="#cite10">[10]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>Division I: Methodology and Theory</b><br>
        Led by Dr. Marques herself, this division focuses on refining TRM protocols, developing theoretical frameworks for understanding temporal resonance, and establishing quality standards for the field. Recent work has explored the relationship between TRM findings and <a href="chronological-asymmetry.html">chronological asymmetry</a> theory, investigating whether resonance signatures reflect shared asymmetry fluctuations among witnesses.<sup><a href="#cite11">[11]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>Division II: Historical Investigation</b><br>
        Led by Dr. Ricardo Ferreira, this division applies TRM methodology to reconstruct historical temporal anomaly events. Major projects have included investigations of the <a href="silent-hour-1997.html">Silent Hour of 1997</a>, early <a href="great-meaning-collapse.html">Great Meaning Collapse</a> phases, and several unreported local temporal disturbances in the Iberian Peninsula dating back to the 1980s.<sup><a href="#cite12">[12]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>Division III: Applied Temporality</b><br>
        Established in 2023 and led by Dr. Catarina Vieira, this division explores practical applications of collective temporality research. Current projects include forensic applications (in collaboration with Dr. Lucia Fernandez at the Madrid Laboratory for Meaning Verification), therapeutic protocols for "orphaned temporal trauma," and developing TRM-based tools for organizational memory recovery.<sup><a href="#cite13">[13]</a></sup></p>

        <h2 id="Facilities">Facilities<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="#">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <p>The Centre's Belém facility was designed specifically for collective temporal research and incorporates several specialized features:<sup><a href="#cite14">[14]</a></sup></p>

        <h2 id="Projects">Notable projects<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="#">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <p><b>Pre-Collapse Mapping Project (2019-2021):</b> The Centre's most significant undertaking, this project used TRM to identify precursor events to the <a href="great-meaning-collapse.html">Great Meaning Collapse of 2019</a>. Researchers mapped the experiences of 234 participants across four cities, identifying localized temporal disturbances that preceded the main collapse. The findings suggested that the collapse was not a sudden event but a gradual process with detectable early signatures.<sup><a href="#cite18">[18]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>Silent Hour Reconstruction (ongoing):</b> A long-term project to reconstruct the temporal experience of the <a href="silent-hour-1997.html">Silent Hour of 1997</a> using elderly participants who were present in affected areas. Challenges include participant age-related cognitive changes and the difficulty of distinguishing genuine resonance from accumulated cultural knowledge about the event.<sup><a href="#cite19">[19]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>Asymmetry-Resonance Integration (2024-present):</b> A collaborative project with Dr. Tobias Lindqvist exploring the relationship between <a href="chronological-asymmetry.html">chronological asymmetry</a> theory and TRM findings. Preliminary results suggest that strong resonance signatures correlate with periods of reduced asymmetry maintenance among witnesses—supporting the hypothesis that shared temporal experiences may arise from synchronized asymmetry fluctuations.<sup><a href="#cite20">[20]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>Forensic TRM Standards Development (2022-present):</b> Working with Dr. Lucia Fernandez and the International Association of Semantic Forensics, the Centre has helped develop standards for the admissibility of TRM evidence in legal proceedings. Portuguese courts began accepting TRM evidence in <a href="temporal-debt.html">temporal debt</a> cases in 2023, following Danish precedent.<sup><a href="#cite21">[21]</a></sup></p>

        <h2 id="Controversy">Controversy<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="#">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <p>The Centre has faced several controversies since its founding:</p>

        <p><b>Methodology criticism:</b> Dr. <a href="marcus-chen.html">Marcus Chen</a> has been persistently critical of TRM, arguing that the methodology lacks empirical rigor and that "resonance" is unfalsifiable. Chen's 2022 paper "The Problem with Temporal Resonance Mapping" accused the Centre of "institutionalizing unfounded assumptions about temporal accessibility." Marques responded that TRM has produced verifiable predictions, citing the Pre-Collapse Mapping Project's identification of precursor events subsequently confirmed by other methods.<sup><a href="#cite24">[24]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>Barcelona incident (2020):</b> A TRM session targeting the <a href="silent-hour-1997.html">Silent Hour of 1997</a>, conducted in Barcelona with Centre involvement, resulted in temporary catatonia in three participants—a "resonance cascade" event. While the Centre was not the primary operator, critics questioned whether adequate safety protocols had been followed. The incident led to the current seven-person limit and mandatory <a href="semantic-quarantine-protocols.html">semantic quarantine protocols</a> for all TRM sessions.<sup><a href="#cite25">[25]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>Paradox Foundation funding:</b> The Centre's acceptance of grants from the Paradox Foundation, a private organization with opaque interests in temporal research, has drawn criticism from researchers who question the Foundation's motives. Marques has stated that all Centre research is published openly and that the Foundation has not influenced research directions.<sup><a href="#cite26">[26]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>Deep stratum access:</b> Some Centre research necessarily involves accessing deep <a href="psychostrata.html">psychostratic</a> layers, placing it within the scope of the <a href="stratum-vii-ethics-debate.html">Stratum VII Research Ethics Debate</a>. Critics argue that collective mapping of deep strata poses risks that individual consciousness archaeology does not—the potential for group-level psychostratic disturbance. The Centre maintains strict protocols and has contributed to international ethics guidelines for collective temporal research.<sup><a href="#cite27">[27]</a></sup></p>
