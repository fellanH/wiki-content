        <p><b>Ines Maria Cardoso Marques</b> (born 1974) is a Portuguese researcher in collective temporality, <a href="consciousness-archaeology.html">consciousness archaeology</a>, and chronopsychology. She is the founding director of the <a href="lisbon-centre-for-collective-temporality.html">Lisbon Centre for Collective Temporality</a> (CLTC) and the developer of <a href="temporal-resonance-mapping.html">Temporal Resonance Mapping</a> (TRM), a methodology for reconstructing shared temporal experiences that cannot be accessed through individual memory retrieval.<sup><a href="#cite1">[1]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Marques first gained recognition for her investigation of the <a href="lisbon-retrograde-event.html">Lisbon Retrograde Event of 2008</a>, a localized temporal perception anomaly in which approximately 8,200 individuals experienced 23 minutes of subjective time flowing in reverse. Her documentation of this event, published in the 2011 monograph <i>Backward Time</i>, established her as a leading figure in the emerging field of collective temporal studies. Her subsequent theoretical work—particularly the concepts of "temporal entanglement," the "interstitial stratum," and the "temporal eddy model"—has shaped contemporary understanding of how temporal experiences are shared across multiple consciousnesses.<sup><a href="#cite2">[2]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Under her leadership, the CLTC has become the world's premier institution for research on collective temporal phenomena. The Centre's Pre-Collapse Mapping Project (2019-2021), which identified previously unknown precursor events to the <a href="great-meaning-collapse.html">Great Meaning Collapse of 2019</a>, demonstrated the practical value of TRM methodology and established the technique as a legitimate investigative tool.<sup><a href="#cite3">[3]</a></sup></p>

        <h2 id="Early_life">Early life and education<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="#">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <p>Marques was born in 1974 in Coimbra, Portugal, to Manuel Marques, a civil engineer, and Clara Cardoso Marques, a secondary school history teacher. She has described her childhood fascination with her mother's accounts of collective historical experiences—how communities remembered shared events differently from official records—as formative to her later research interests.<sup><a href="#cite4">[4]</a></sup></p>

        <p>She completed her undergraduate studies in psychology at the University of Coimbra (1996), where she became interested in the philosophy of time after encountering the work of Henri Bergson and Edmund Husserl. Her undergraduate thesis, "The Lived Moment: Subjective Duration in Portuguese Oral History," combined ethnographic fieldwork with phenomenological analysis, establishing patterns that would characterize her later methodology.<sup><a href="#cite5">[5]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Marques pursued doctoral studies in cognitive science at Universidade Nova de Lisboa, completing her PhD in 2004 under the supervision of Professor António Damásio (before his departure for USC) and later Professor Maria Fernandes. Her dissertation, "Temporal Binding in Collective Memory: Evidence from the Carnation Revolution Commemorations," examined how individuals who participated in Portugal's 1974 revolution synchronized their temporal memories during commemorative gatherings.<sup><a href="#cite6">[6]</a></sup></p>

        <blockquote>
            "I remember sitting in a room full of elderly revolutionaries during the 30th anniversary celebrations, listening to them tell stories. What struck me was not what they remembered, but how their memories seemed to pulse together—as if they were still connected by something that happened decades ago. I didn't have the vocabulary for it then. Now I would call it temporal resonance."<br>
            — Dr. Ines Marques, interview with <i>Consciousness Studies Review</i> (2019)

        <h3 id="Retrograde">The Lisbon Retrograde Event</h3>

        <p>Marques's career was transformed by her accidental discovery of the <a href="lisbon-retrograde-event.html">Lisbon Retrograde Event</a> in late 2008. While conducting unrelated research on temporal perception in bilingual speakers, she interviewed participants who independently described identical anomalous experiences from September 18, 2008—a localized period during which subjective time appeared to flow in reverse.<sup><a href="#cite7">[7]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Initially skeptical, Marques expanded her investigation after three unconnected participants placed identical experiences—reversed causality, "unthinking" thoughts, conversations that unspooled backward—at the same location and time. Over the following three years, she documented over 340 corroborated accounts, eventually estimating that approximately 8,200 individuals had been affected. Her meticulous documentation established the Retrograde Event as one of the most thoroughly investigated temporal anomalies on record.<sup><a href="#cite8">[8]</a></sup></p>

        <p>The investigation proved methodologically challenging. Witnesses struggled to describe experiences that violated normal cause-and-effect grammar, and Marques had to develop new interview techniques to elicit coherent accounts. This experience shaped her later emphasis on phenomenological rigor and her sensitivity to the linguistic dimensions of temporal experience.<sup><a href="#cite9">[9]</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="CLTC">Founding of the CLTC</h3>

        <p>The Retrograde Event investigation revealed a phenomenon that Marques would term "interstitial memory"—traces of shared experiences that could not be recovered from any individual witness but seemed to persist in the relational space between witnesses. Her 2013 paper articulating this concept attracted attention from funding bodies, leading to the establishment of the <a href="lisbon-centre-for-collective-temporality.html">Lisbon Centre for Collective Temporality</a> in 2014.<sup><a href="#cite10">[10]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Under Marques's leadership, the CLTC grew from 8 researchers in temporary facilities to 47 researchers across three divisions by 2025. The Centre's purpose-built Belém facility, completed in 2017, incorporates specialized isolation chambers and a resonance laboratory designed specifically for collective temporal research.<sup><a href="#cite11">[11]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Marques has maintained direct involvement in research while managing the institution, personally leading major projects including the Pre-Collapse Mapping Project and the ongoing Asymmetry-Resonance Integration study with Dr. Tobias Lindqvist. Colleagues describe her leadership style as "rigorously collaborative," emphasizing methodology development and international partnerships over institutional competition.<sup><a href="#cite12">[12]</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="TRM">Development of TRM</h3>

        <p>Marques devoted the CLTC's first years to developing the methodology that would become <a href="temporal-resonance-mapping.html">Temporal Resonance Mapping</a>. Building on her observations from the Retrograde Event investigation, she designed protocols for detecting and reconstructing shared temporal experiences through synchronized examination of multiple witnesses.<sup><a href="#cite13">[13]</a></sup></p>

        <p>The breakthrough came in late 2016, when researchers successfully reconstructed a shared temporal experience—a minor power fluctuation during a 2009 academic conference—that no individual participant could consciously recall but which produced measurable resonance signatures when participants were examined together. This demonstration that collective temporal experiences leave detectable traces even when individually forgotten established TRM as a viable research methodology.<sup><a href="#cite14">[14]</a></sup></p>

        <p>The formal methodology, published in 2017, introduced several key innovations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The <b>Marques Resonance Coefficient</b> (MRC), a quantitative measure of correlation strength between participants' phenomenological reports</li>
            <li><b>Isolation-convergence protocols</b> that balance individual preparation with group-level pattern detection</li>
            <li>The concept of <b>"receptive depth"</b>—a preparatory state for accessing relational memory deposits</li>
            <li>Standards for distinguishing genuine resonance from confabulation artifacts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>TRM has since been adopted by institutions including the <a href="reykjavik-institute-for-boundary-consciousness.html">Reykjavik Institute for Boundary Consciousness</a> and the <a href="prague-institute-for-liminal-studies.html">Prague Institute for Liminal Studies</a>, and has gained acceptance in legal proceedings in Portugal and Denmark for temporal debt liability cases.<sup><a href="#cite15">[15]</a></sup></p>

        <h2 id="Contributions">Theoretical contributions<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="#">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <p>Beyond TRM methodology, Marques has contributed several influential theoretical concepts to the field of collective temporality:</p>

        <p><b>The temporal eddy model:</b> Proposed to explain the Retrograde Event, this model treats time as analogous to a flowing river in which local "eddies" can cause experienced time to circulate backward while objective time continues forward. Unlike earlier temporal anomaly models that emphasized cessation or fragmentation, the eddy model accounts for continuous reversed experience.<sup><a href="#cite16">[16]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>Temporal entanglement:</b> Marques's controversial term for the phenomenon by which shared temporal experiences create persistent correlations between the <a href="psychostrata.html">psychostratic</a> deposits of witnesses. Critics, particularly Dr. <a href="marcus-chen.html">Marcus Chen</a>, have objected to the quantum-mechanical connotations, but Marques maintains the term captures the non-local character of the phenomenon.<sup><a href="#cite17">[17]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>The interstitial stratum:</b> A theorized layer of collective memory that exists in the relational space between individual memories rather than within any single consciousness. Marques argues that certain experiences—particularly anomalous temporal ones—deposit traces primarily in this interstitial space, explaining why they cannot be recovered through individual memory retrieval.<sup><a href="#cite18">[18]</a></sup></p>

        <div class="quote-highlight">
            "For years, consciousness archaeology had been like trying to reconstruct a symphony by interviewing individual musicians one at a time. We showed that some harmonies only exist when you bring the musicians together and listen to what they still resonate with, not what they remember playing."<br>
            — Dr. Ines Marques, "Introduction to Temporal Resonance" (2018)
        </div>

        <p>Marques's theoretical work has also contributed to understanding the relationship between <a href="chronological-asymmetry.html">chronological asymmetry</a> and collective experience. Her ongoing collaboration with Dr. Tobias Lindqvist has explored whether resonance signatures reflect shared asymmetry fluctuations among witnesses—a finding that, if confirmed, would link TRM to fundamental questions about the nature of temporal experience.<sup><a href="#cite19">[19]</a></sup></p>

        <h2 id="Reception">Reception and criticism<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="#">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <p>Marques's work has received both acclaim and significant criticism.</p>

        <p><b>Recognition:</b> She was awarded the Voss Medal in 2020 for "fundamental contributions to the methodology of temporal experience research." The prize committee cited the Pre-Collapse Mapping Project as demonstrating TRM's practical value for understanding historical temporal anomalies. In 2022, she received the European Consciousness Research Prize for her "paradigm-shifting work on collective temporality."<sup><a href="#cite20">[20]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Dr. Sigríður Jónsdóttir of the <a href="reykjavik-institute-for-boundary-consciousness.html">Reykjavik Institute</a> has described Marques as "perhaps the most important methodological innovator in consciousness studies since the founding of the Prague school," while acknowledging ongoing debates about TRM's theoretical foundations.<sup><a href="#cite21">[21]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>Criticism:</b> Dr. <a href="marcus-chen.html">Marcus Chen</a> has been the most persistent critic of Marques's work, arguing in his 2022 paper "The Problem with Temporal Resonance Mapping" that the methodology lacks empirical rigor and that the "resonance" concept is unfalsifiable. Chen has accused the CLTC of "institutionalizing unfounded assumptions about temporal accessibility."<sup><a href="#cite22">[22]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Marques responded that TRM has produced verifiable predictions, citing the Pre-Collapse Mapping Project's identification of precursor events that were subsequently confirmed through other methods. "Dr. Chen demands the impossible standard that any new methodology must be perfect before it can be used," she wrote in her response. "Science proceeds by using imperfect tools to generate evidence that can be verified by other means."<sup><a href="#cite23">[23]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Additional criticisms have been raised regarding:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cultural bias:</b> Dr. Amara Okonkwo has questioned whether TRM's emphasis on individual isolation may be poorly suited to cultures with stronger traditions of collective memory</li>
            <li><b>Safety concerns:</b> The 2020 Barcelona resonance cascade incident raised questions about whether adequate protocols exist for preventing harm during TRM sessions</li>
            <li><b>Funding sources:</b> The CLTC's acceptance of grants from the Paradox Foundation has drawn criticism, though Marques maintains research independence</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="Personal">Personal life<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="#">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <p>Marques lives in Lisbon and maintains a private personal life. She has mentioned in interviews that she was present in the Baixa-Chiado district on September 18, 2008, but has consistently declined to discuss whether she personally experienced the Retrograde Event. "My role is as an investigator, not a witness," she stated in a 2019 interview. "Whether I experienced it would only complicate my credibility."<sup><a href="#cite24">[24]</a></sup></p>

        <p>She is reported to practice daily meditation, which she credits with developing her capacity for "receptive depth"—the introspective state central to TRM methodology. In a 2021 lecture, she described her meditation practice as "training to listen to what the mind doesn't know it remembers."<sup><a href="#cite25">[25]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Marques is fluent in Portuguese, English, Spanish, and French, and has reading knowledge of German. She has spoken about the importance of multilingualism to her work, noting that temporal concepts often resist direct translation and that understanding how different languages encode time has informed her theoretical development.<sup><a href="#cite26">[26]</a></sup></p>
