        <h2 id="Early_life">Early life and education<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="#">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <p>Chen was born in San Francisco to immigrant parents; his father, Wei Chen, was an electrical engineer at Bell Labs, and his mother, Linda Chen (née Wu), a translator specializing in classical Chinese literature. He has credited his mother's work with ancient texts for his early interest in how meaning persists—or fails to persist—across time.<sup><a href="#cite3">[3]</a></sup></p>

        <p>He attended Lowell High School before earning his Bachelor of Science in Physics from Stanford University in 1998, where he graduated summa cum laude. His undergraduate thesis, supervised by Leonard Susskind, examined time-reversal symmetry in quantum mechanics.</p>

        <p>Chen completed his doctorate at Princeton University in 2004 under the supervision of John Archibald Wheeler, one of the last students Wheeler advised before his retirement. His dissertation, "Temporal Topology and the Limits of Physical Interpretation," established the philosophical framework that would inform his later critiques of chronopsychology.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Wheeler taught me that physics is not about equations. It's about understanding what questions are even coherent to ask. Many questions in chronopsychology, I came to believe, are not coherent—not because they're wrong, but because they're malformed."<br>
            — Marcus Chen, <i>The Physics Today Interview</i>, 2020
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="Academic_career">Academic career<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="#">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <p>Following his doctorate, Chen held postdoctoral positions at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (2004-2006) and CERN (2006-2008). He joined MIT as an Assistant Professor in 2008 and was granted tenure in 2014.</p>

        <p>Chen's early work focused on conventional theoretical physics, particularly the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity. His transition to philosophy of time—and eventually to critiques of chronopsychology—began with a 2015 sabbatical at Oxford, where he encountered the emerging literature on <a href="temporal-debt.html">temporal debt</a> and <a href="semantic-hygiene.html">semantic hygiene</a>.</p>

        <p>"I picked up Helena Voss's book expecting to find pseudoscience," Chen later recalled. "Instead I found something more troubling: a sophisticated theoretical framework that made testable predictions but rested on premises I couldn't reconcile with known physics."<sup><a href="#cite4">[4]</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="Temporal_debt_critique">Critique of temporal debt</h3>

        <p>Chen's critique of <a href="temporal-debt.html">temporal debt</a> theory, first articulated in his 2019 paper, rests on three principal objections:</p>

        <p><b>The Conservation Problem</b>: Chen argues that temporal debt implies the creation or destruction of subjective time, which would violate conservation principles. "If I can 'borrow' future experience, what is the carrier of that debt? Where is the experiential energy stored before it is 'repaid'?"<sup><a href="#cite5">[5]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>The Measurement Problem</b>: The Voss-hour (Vh) unit, Chen contends, lacks clear operational definition. "We cannot measure a Voss-hour independently of the subjective reports that the concept is meant to explain. This is circular."<sup><a href="#cite5">[5]</a></sup></p>

        <p><b>The Falsifiability Problem</b>: Chen notes that any apparent "repayment" of temporal debt can be attributed to natural variation in time perception, making the core hypothesis unfalsifiable.</p>

        <p>Chen has applied similar critiques to <a href="anticipatory-semantic-retrieval.html">anticipatory semantic retrieval</a> (ASR), arguing that the concept of a "pre-conscious semantic reservoir" lacks operational definition and that ASR's subjective indicators cannot distinguish genuine retrieval from ordinary creative processes.<sup><a href="#cite6">[6]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Defenders of temporal debt theory, including Dr. Helena Voss herself, have responded that Chen applies inappropriately physicalist standards to phenomenological concepts. The debate continues in academic literature.<sup><a href="#cite6">[6]</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="Continuous_model">Continuous semantic velocity model</h3>

        <p>In response to the <a href="great-meaning-collapse.html">Great Meaning Collapse of 2019</a>, Chen proposed what he termed the "continuous semantic velocity model" as an alternative to catastrophist interpretations of the event.</p>

        <p>Rather than viewing the August 2019 events as a sudden "collapse," Chen argued that <a href="semantic-drift.html">semantic drift</a> operates continuously at varying velocities, and that the 2019 event represented merely a crossing of the "perception threshold"—the point at which gradual change becomes sudden enough for humans to notice.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Calling it a 'collapse' implies there was a stable structure that suddenly failed. But meaning has always been in motion. What happened in 2019 was not a collapse—it was a velocity increase that crossed the threshold of human perception. We didn't witness language breaking; we witnessed ourselves noticing that it was always breaking."<sup><a href="#cite7">[7]</a></sup>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This view has been criticized by practitioners of <a href="semantic-stratigraphy.html">semantic stratigraphy</a>, who point to clear discontinuities in the August 2019 "meaning deposits."<sup><a href="#cite8">[8]</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="Physical_constraints">Physical constraints on chronopsychology</h3>

        <p>Chen's most systematic work appears in his 2023 book <i>The Physics of Experience: What Time Perception Cannot Be</i>, which attempts to establish boundary conditions on any viable theory of temporal experience based on known physics.</p>

        <p>Key arguments include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Neural substrate limits</b>: Any theory of time perception must be implementable in biological neural networks with known properties</li>
            <li><b>Information-theoretic constraints</b>: Subjective time cannot "store" more information than the brain can physically encode</li>
            <li><b>Thermodynamic arrow</b>: Temporal experience must align with the thermodynamic arrow of time; "borrowing" from the future implies retrocausality</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The book received mixed reviews. Dr. Amara Okonkwo of the <a href="consciousness-archaeology.html">Lagos Institute for Cognitive Archaeology</a> called it "a rigorous but ultimately provincial critique—the work of a physicist who cannot accept that physics may not be the final vocabulary."<sup><a href="#cite9">[9]</a></sup></p>

        <h2 id="Controversies">Controversies<span class="mw-editsection">[<a href="#">edit</a>]</span></h2>

        <div class="controversy-box">
            <p><b>The Oslo Correspondence</b> (2022): A series of emails between Chen and researchers at the <a href="oslo-lexical-decay-observatory.html">Oslo Lexical Decay Observatory</a> were leaked to academic media. In the correspondence, Chen accused the Observatory of "confirmation bias institutionalized as methodology." Dr. Ingrid Solheim responded publicly, defending the Observatory's empirical rigor and suggesting Chen suffered from "physics imperialism."<sup><a href="#cite10">[10]</a></sup></p>
        </div>

        <p>Chen's participation in the 2023 Edinburgh Symposium on Temporal Studies became contentious when he described the field of <a href="semantic-plasticity.html">semantic plasticity</a> as "phenomenologically suggestive but ontologically hollow." Several attendees walked out during his keynote address. Chen later apologized for his "undiplomatic phrasing" while maintaining his substantive criticisms.<sup><a href="#cite11">[11]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Despite these conflicts, Chen maintains collaborative relationships with several chronolinguistics researchers. He has co-authored papers with Dr. Kazuki Morrison on the mathematics of meaning change, approaching the subject from their respectively skeptical and phenomenological perspectives.<sup><a href="#cite12">[12]</a></sup></p>
